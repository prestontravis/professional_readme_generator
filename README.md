# Professional-Readme-To-Go
  
  ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)


  ## Description:
A project that generates your own "README.md" file using the command line interface. It's a much more efficient way to create your "README.me" files. The newly created README.md file will be in the "Develop" folder after you've run "node index.js" in the integraded terminal. Don't forget to view the video demo and right click "Open Preview" on the README.md file!
